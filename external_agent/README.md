## Starter Guide to Using the External Agent Feature

### Create the Agent
Begin by creating an agent that exposes a chat streaming endpoint. Ensure the endpoint adheres to the specified standards and streams events correctly according to the [provided specifications](spec.yaml).

### Implement Authentication
The agent must support authentication through either of the following methods:

1. Bearer Token Authentication
2. API Key Authentication using an `x-api-key` header.

### Deploy the Agent
Once the agent is ready, deploy it externally (e.g., using [code engine](https://www.ibm.com/products/code-engine)).

### Register the Agent
After deployment, register the agent according to the instructions provided in our product documentation.
